AI Futures Bot Roadmap (BTC/SOL, Bybit, GPT-4 + TimeGPT)

Goal: Build a precision AI bot using GPT-4 + TimeGPT with 80%+ prediction or win accuracy before going live.

Week 1: Foundation + Tooling

Objective: Set up your environment, data pipeline, and modeling interface

Tasks:
 • Set up development stack
 • Python 3.10+
 • Jupyter or VSCode
 • Install key libraries: ccxt, TA-Lib, pandas-ta, openai, requests, websockets, etc.
 • Integrate Bybit API
 • Use REST for historical OHLCV
 • Use WebSockets for live data
 • Create basic TA engine
 • Calculate RSI, MACD, EMA, Bollinger Bands, etc.
 • Save structured TA output per candle
 • Get TimeGPT API access (Nixtla)
 • Test basic price forecasting with dummy OHLCV

Deliverable:
 • Working data feed from Bybit
 • TA indicator generator
 • First TimeGPT forecast output in notebook or script

Week 2: GPT-4 Signal System

Objective: Use GPT-4 to evaluate TA + forecasts and generate trade decisions

Tasks:
 • Design a data schema to feed GPT-4:

{
  "pair": "BTCUSDT",
  "timeframe": "5m",
  "price": 61850,
  "forecast_next_5m": 62100,
  "indicators": {
    "RSI": 71.3,
    "MACD": {"histogram": 180, "signal": 175},
    "EMA20": 61500,
    "EMA50": 61000,
    "ATR": 180
  },
  "trend": "Uptrend",
  "volume_spike": true,
  "candle_pattern": "Bullish Engulfing"
}

 • Build GPT-4 prompt loop:
 • Feed TA + forecast + context into prompt
 • Ask for: entry, confidence (0–100%), SL/TP levels
 • Store GPT-4 responses + predictions in a local database (SQLite or Postgres)

Deliverable:
 • Script that takes real-time TA + forecast, gets trade recommendation from GPT-4

Week 3: Backtesting + Paper Trade Engine

Objective: Validate system decisions on historical and live data

Tasks:
 • Implement a simple backtester
 • Use historical OHLCV
 • Feed data as if live to GPT-4 + TimeGPT
 • Evaluate accuracy, win rate, risk/reward
 • Set up paper trading mode using Bybit testnet
 • Log positions, PnL, SL/TP hits
 • Build metrics dashboard (plot win %, avg RR, hit rate)

Deliverable:
 • Paper trading bot that runs live and logs performance metrics

Week 4: Refinement + Automation

Objective: Tune the model, reduce bad trades, and set up alerting

Tasks:
 • Analyze results:
 • Why did some trades fail? Overconfidence? SL too tight?
 • Adjust prompts or TA logic accordingly
 • Add filtering:
 • Only enter trades where GPT-4 confidence > 85% and forecast agrees
 • Require signal confluence (e.g., RSI + MACD + forecast + price level)
 • Automate signal notifications (Telegram, Discord, or dashboard)
 • Prepare for scaling (multi-timeframe logic, more robust logging)

Deliverable:
 • Self-contained decision system ready for forward-testing
 •  80% win rate or prediction accuracy achieved in paper tests

Post-Roadmap: Go/No-Go Decision
 • If >80% win rate or strong prediction edge:
 • Gradually test with small real capital
 • Add capital scaling and position sizing logic
 • If not:
 • Analyze weak points, retrain prompts, adjust filters
 • Collect 1000+ more paper trades before retrying live
