Project Overview – AI Futures Trading Bot

Goal

Develop a high-precision AI-powered trading bot that executes or signals futures trades on BTC or SOL using GPT-4 for trade evaluation and TimeGPT for short-term market forecasting.

The bot will only go live once it achieves a consistent >80% win rate or prediction accuracy during forward-testing (paper trading) on Bybit.

Key Components
 • Platform: Bybit (Testnet → Live)
 • Assets: BTC/USDT or SOL/USDT (1–2 pairs only)
 • AI Decision Engine: GPT-4-Turbo via OpenAI API
 • Forecasting Model: TimeGPT (via Nixtla API)
 • Technical Analysis: TA-Lib / pandas-ta (RSI, MACD, EMAs, etc.)
 • Execution Logic: Python-based bot with WebSocket streaming + REST control
 • Confidence Control: Only trade when model confidence > 80–85%
 • Backtesting Mode: Historical replay of OHLCV + GPT-4 + forecast
 • Paper Trading Mode: Full system simulated on Bybit Testnet

Success Criteria
 • 80%+ win rate over at least 500 paper trades
 • Model precision in identifying high-confluence entry/exit setups
 • Robust TA + forecast-driven entry logic
 • Error handling, stop-loss, and take-profit automation
 • Scalable to more pairs or timeframes later

Stretch Goals
 • Telegram/Discord alerts
 • Dynamic position sizing based on forecast confidence
 • Real-time PnL tracking and risk management dashboard
 • Eventually add a supervised learning model to improve long-term strategy evolution
